# Polygon_Touch_Sensitive_Lights
Inspired by the Helios Touch Modular Lights, I thought that developing this project would be neat way to learn about touch sensors while saving some money on the decoration for my brother's room

**Introduction** | The two unique things about the [Helios Touch Modular Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU_aIq55b4o), is that they _use magnets_ as a way to arrange the modules in different ways and they also are _touch sensitive_. This project is being developed as a means of learning about the concepts used behind this lighting device, as well as a way to save money - as the Helios Touch Modular Lights sell for over $120. I hope to keep this project under $20 in parts ordered online, with the help of 3D printing the housings for each module on my own printer. 

**Navigation** | I've yet to start with the beef of the project, so not much navigation is required at this point. Come back later for more progress

**Results** | This project is still in the build phase, so I don't have any results to share with you quite yet.

**Credits** | Inspiration from Helios Touch Modular Lights

**Status of the Project** | First revision design process - no schematic yet, and protoyped or working yet.

REVISION 1: In the process of being designed and built - stay tuned
